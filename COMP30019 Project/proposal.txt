Game Title: BEWARE THE RHINO!

Summary:
We propose creating a similar game to Dragon fly, utilising Direct3D graphics
and the touch and accelerometer inputs of the Samsung slate PC. The player will
start from the highest point of a 3D world generated using an algorithm such as 
plasma fractal, and the objective of the game will be to obtain as many points
as they can within a time limit. Tilting the slate will move the character, and
swiping will rotate the camera view.

Type of application: Metro app
Genre: Action arcade game

Hardware Input:
We will be using Samsung Slate Series 7 for simulation and base design of this game,
especially the accelerometer and touch screen as the input of the game.

Visualisation:
- The camera will be following character and the direction it's facing, in 3rd person view.
- The terrain brightness/light level will depend on the terrain altitude (i.e., 
  if the ground is high, then that area will be brighter).
- The polygons that will be in the game will be (mainly) the player, some target dummy and the tarreain itself.

Milestones:
1. Terrain generation (e.g. using plasma fractal)
2. Rendering the terrain, player and objects.
- At later stage, the player will be more detailed.
3. Implement the camera view + control
4. The physics of the world and player movement control
- Calculation from player input and physics of the world to predict player movement.
5. Handling input from the touch screen and accelerometers.
6. Adding obstacle/target and time limit in game.
7. Implement scoring system.

Additional ideas:
- Player will wrap around the world when they reach edge of the world
- Additional obstacles/enemies
- Levelling system
- Change of character
- Map themes
- Special properties of character (e.g. skill, stats)
- GUI screens (e.g. main menu) 
- Achievements
